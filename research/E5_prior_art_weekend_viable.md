# Weekend Civic Tech That Works: Fast Paths to Service Navigation and Transparency

## Executive Summary

When building civic tech in a 48–72 hour weekend hackathon, scope constraint is the primary predictor of success. Evidence from recent municipal and international hackathons reveals a stark contrast between what teams *attempt* and what actually wins. Dashboards are the lowest-friction weekend win; for example, Seattle hosted a mini-hackathon where 10 teams successfully built open data dashboards in just three hours [1]. Conversely, "whole-lifecycle procurement" tools exceed weekend scope, as demonstrated by the Open Contracting Partnership's Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, which required a seven-week development phase for complex infrastructure monitors [2]. 

Judges consistently reward problem clarity, completion, and applicability over feature breadth. Rubrics heavily weight "Applicability" and "Impact" [3] [4]. Therefore, anchoring an MVP to a concrete City Hall persona and delivering a working, clickable demo with real data is the optimal strategy for a weekend build.

## Scope Reality Check — What 48–72 Hours Actually Supports

Working demos with narrow scope consistently outperform ambitious, unfinished systems in civic hackathons. The reality of civic tech development is that data wrangling and integration consume the majority of time. 

The City of Seattle's Open Data Mini-Hackathon proved that rapid delivery is possible when scope is tightly constrained: 10 teams comprising 58 people successfully built and presented data dashboards in just three hours [1]. In contrast, tackling complex, multi-source procurement problems requires significantly more time. The Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, which focused on using open data in public procurement to meet Sustainable Development Goals, gave its finalists a seven-week development and training phase before pitching [2]. For a weekend hackathon, teams must constrain their build to 1–2 datasets and a single decisive user journey, reserving 30–40% of their time for demo preparation and storytelling.

## Evidence of Fast Wins — 3-Hour Dashboards as the Benchmark

Data storytelling with simple tools is highly achievable and scores exceptionally well with judges. In Seattle's mini-hackathon, the winning teams utilized tools like Tableau and R Shiny to create compelling visualizations of building permit data [1]. 

The competition was judged on impact, messaging, creativity, and design, with bonus points specifically awarded for incorporating the City's Racial and Social Equity Index [1]. The first-place team won by mapping multifamily building permit data directly onto this equity index, demonstrating that combining a core dataset with a contextual equity layer is a winning formula for rapid civic tech builds [1].

## MVP Feasibility Snapshot — What's In/Out for This Weekend

Based on hackathon outcomes and technical quickstarts, here is the feasibility assessment for the requested MVP shapes:

| MVP Shape | Weekend Feasible? | Demo-Ready Threshold | Main Risks | Fastest Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contract Expiry Dashboard** | Yes | Filters for 30/60/90 days; department/vendor breakdown; detail view | Dirty/missing dates; vendor deduplication | Tableau Public or R Shiny |
| **311 Decision-Tree via SMS** | Yes (scoped) | 5–8 paths working end-to-end; error and "hand-off" path | Authoring logic and copy; channel sprawl | Twilio Studio + Functions |
| **LLM PDF Contract Extraction** | Conditional | 5–10 known-format PDFs; fixed fields; human-check UI | Unreliable parsing; model hallucination | Narrow prompt + rule-based fallback |
| **rva.gov Crawl + Search** | Conditional | Index limited subtree; keyword search UI | robots.txt/sitemap limits; crawl time | Sitemap fetch + static index |

*Key Takeaway:* Dashboards and scoped SMS 311 tools are green-lit for weekend builds. LLM extraction and full-site searches carry high risks of incompletion and require strict scoping to be demo-safe.

## 311 Decision-Tree Helper — Fastest Path to a Credible Demo

A decision-tree 311 helper is highly feasible in 48 hours if you leverage low-code communication platforms and strictly limit the scope of the tree. Twilio provides comprehensive quickstarts for Python, Node.js, and other languages to programmatically send and receive SMS messages [5]. 

To succeed, teams should limit the prototype to the top 5–8 311 intents, implement a single language, and stick to one channel (starting with SMS). The most time-consuming part will not be the coding, but rather authoring the decision logic and the conversational copy. Because hackathon rubrics heavily weight "Applicability" (up to 30% of the final score) and "Impact" (20%) [4], ensuring the user journey makes sense for a resident is more important than building a massive, multi-channel routing engine.

## Procurement Transparency — Contract Expiry Dashboard in 48 Hours

A basic, useful contract dashboard is a high-confidence deliverable for a weekend hackathon. The UK Open Government Partnership has highlighted the need for interactive dashboards that provide real-time insights and simplify complex procurement data into user-friendly visualizations for the public [6]. 

If a city portal exposes procurement data via CSV, teams can ingest and normalize date fields and supplier names rapidly. A successful 48-hour build should focus on a dashboard showing contracts expiring in 30/60/90 days, broken down by department and vendor. As proven by the Seattle hackathon, this can be achieved in mere hours using tools like Tableau [1].

## LLM PDF Extraction — Risk-Managed Scoping for a Judge-Safe Demo

LLM-powered PDF extraction is feasible but highly risky for a weekend hackathon. Hackathon rubrics penalize weak technical implementation; for instance, the IN-EDU guidelines allocate 20% of the score to technical implementation, asking if the appropriate technologies are used correctly and if there is good usability [4]. 

Without schema-consistent PDFs and strict guardrails, LLM extraction errors will undermine the perceived quality of the prototype. To make this feasible, teams must scope the demo to 5–10 known-format PDFs with a fixed field list. The demo should feature a side-by-side extraction screen with a manual human-check step, framing the tool as "assisted extraction" rather than fully autonomous processing.

## City Website Crawl + Search — Feasibility Checkpoints

Building a crawler and search layer for a municipal site (like rva.gov) is conditionally feasible if teams avoid scale pitfalls. Success hinges on respecting `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` allowances and staying within static indexing. 

Judges favor completion and immediate usefulness [7]. Attempting to crawl an entire city domain will likely result in an unfinished, buggy demo. Instead, teams should limit the crawl to a constrained subtree (e.g., only procurement policies or specific service pages), fetch sitemap URLs, index titles and snippets locally, and wrap it in a simple search UI.

## Judging and Demo Strategy — Designing for How Civic Hacks are Scored

Understanding the judging criteria is critical for weekend success. Devpost's Civic Tech Hackathon 2025 rubric focuses on "Product-Need Fit" (how well the solution solves a problem), "Potential Impact," "Technical Execution," "Design," and "Presentation" [3]. Similarly, Technical.ly's guidelines ask judges to evaluate if the project has reached a "stage of completion" and if it will enact an "immediate or near-term change" for a clear user [7].

Teams must script a 5-minute narrative that clearly identifies the user, the problem, and features a live demo. Showing a completed, narrow workflow will always score higher than presenting an ambitious but broken prototype.

## Common Scoping Mistakes — What Mentors Warn Against

Experienced organizers and mentors explicitly warn against over-breadth. The IN-EDU guidelines remind participants that a hackathon is "not about solving a problem for 24 hours," but rather about designing and prototyping solutions in a time-boxed scenario [4]. 

Common mistakes include:
* Attempting multi-system integrations.
* Designing for vague users (e.g., "the general public") rather than specific personas.
* Falling into data wrangling rabbit holes that leave no time to build a visible demo.
Teams should pre-decide on one persona, reuse existing datasets, and explicitly show how their prototype complements—rather than duplicates—existing city portals [7].

## Technical Stack Patterns — Tools That Compress Build Time

No-code/low-code and serverless architectures win the weekend. 
* **Dashboards:** Tableau Public or R Shiny allow teams to build prize-winning visualizations in under three hours [1].
* **311/Communications:** Twilio's APIs and SDKs (with ngrok for local testing) provide hours-level scaffolding for SMS and voice applications [5].
* **Crawl/Search:** Simple sitemap fetching combined with a static index (SQLite/JSON) avoids the overhead of deploying complex search clusters.

## Time Budget — Estimates Grounded in Referenced Events

To succeed in 48 hours, teams must front-load data preparation and demo polish.
* **Contract Expiry Dashboard (Tableau/Shiny):** Data ingest/clean (2–3 hours); Charts and filters (2–3 hours); Context layer join (1 hour); Demo script and QA (1–2 hours). Total: ~6–9 hours.
* **311 SMS Triage (Twilio):** Setup and ngrok (1–2 hours) [5]; Authoring logic/copy (4–6 hours); Building flow (2–3 hours); Demo prep (1–2 hours). Total: ~8–13 hours.

## Data/Access Prerequisites — Remove Blockers Early

A 30–60 minute pre-flight check avoids half-day stalls. Teams must confirm dataset URLs and formats (CSV), secure necessary API keys, set up accounts (e.g., Twilio, Tableau Public), install local tunneling tools like ngrok [5], and verify `robots.txt` allowances before the coding begins.

## Post-Hackathon Maturation Plan — From Demo to Pilot

A weekend hackathon produces a prototype, not a production system. As seen in the Taiwan Presidential Hackathon, moving from an initial idea to a robust civic tool requires weeks of dedicated development and training [2]. Post-hackathon, teams should plan a 2–6 week runway to add data validation tests, handle edge cases, expand datasets, and engage directly with municipal stakeholders (like procurement officers or 311 operators) to secure adoption.
