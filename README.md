This is a guided decision environment for teams working on the A Thriving City Hall pillar. It's designed to help you quickly choose a credible, source‑linked, weekend‑buildable MVP—and avoid fantasy software.

Journey stages: Land → Orient → Choose → Research → Compare MVPs → Lock Scope → Build → Validate → Demo → Hand‑off

Three questions to answer fast: 1) What problem are we actually solving? 2) Can we credibly demo by Sunday? 3) What should we refuse to build?

## Quick Start

Do these first 15–30 minutes to get moving:

1) Read: `QUICKSTART.md`
2) Skim: `00_core/00_pillar_overview.md` and `01_problem_space/02_targeted_problem_statements.md`
3) Capture a 5‑bullet "Working Direction" using `99_templates/working_direction_note.md`
4) Decide your path:
   - Path A — already have a rough problem: jump to Phase 2 and Phase 4
   - Path B — need help choosing: start at Phase 1 and proceed in order

---

## Guardrails

- Pick one user, one workflow, and one credible data/doc base.
- Avoid eligibility/legal determinations and policy/integration dependencies.
- Always cite official sources. Log every claim in `evidence_log.md`.
- Keep AI constrained to explanation, retrieval, comparison, and guidance.
- Never claim post-2018 RVA311 data is accessible via API — it is not.

## Decision Phases

<details open>
<summary><strong>Phase 0 — Landing & Framing</strong></summary>

Goal: understand what this repo is and how to use it without "exploring" for two hours.

What this pillar is about:
- Government service delivery, resident access to City services, staff efficiency, and procurement integrity under A Thriving City Hall.

Success patterns:
- Source‑linked, narrow scope, credible demo, explicit limits.

Anti‑patterns:
- Platform claims; eligibility/legal decisions; policy/integration dependencies; private data needs; tools requiring post-2018 311 API access.

Admin quick links:
- Research hub: `research_notes.md`
- Evidence tracker: `evidence_log.md`
- Source inventory (CSV): `02_data/source_inventory.csv`
- Artifacts: see Repo Map above

Call to action: choose Path A or Path B.

</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>Phase 1 — Rapid Orientation (20–30 min)</strong></summary>

Read just enough to build a shared mental model:
- `QUICKSTART.md`
- `00_core/00_pillar_overview.md`
- `00_core/01_map_alignment.md`
- `01_problem_space/02_targeted_problem_statements.md`

Filter for:
- user groups; pain points; what the City actually cares about
- problems that are software‑shaped vs policy‑shaped

Team checkpoint — Working Direction (use `99_templates/working_direction_note.md`):

```
## Working Direction
- Pillar: A Thriving City Hall
- Candidate problem:
- Likely user:
- Why it matters:
- Why it seems weekend-buildable:
- Biggest uncertainty:
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 2 — Problem Selection (30–45 min)</strong></summary>

Files:
- `01_problem_space/01_bluesky_problem_statements.md`
- `01_problem_space/02_targeted_problem_statements.md`
- `00_core/04_solution_patterns.md`
- `05_prompts/01_problem_selection_prompt.md`

Decision rule — choose only if the problem has:
- a real user and understandable workflow
- a plausible public data/document base
- a demoable artifact by Sunday

Output: Decision Memo (`99_templates/decision_memo.md`)

```
## Chosen Problem
## User
## Why this one
## Why not the others
## Risks
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 3 — Research Spin‑Up (60–90 min)</strong></summary>

Goal: gather just enough evidence to avoid fantasy software.

Use the runner to execute targeted prompts and capture findings:
- Perplexity runner: `05_prompts/perplexity_runner/` (see its README)
- Data index: `02_data/00_index.md`

Evidence Log structure (log in `evidence_log.md`):

```
## Evidence Log
### Confirmed
### Likely but unverified
### Missing
### Useful datasets
### Useful source documents
### Prior art
### Risks
```

Tip: parse URLs from API metadata; don't ask for URLs in prompt text.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 4 — Opportunity Framing (45–60 min)</strong></summary>

Compare at least two MVP shapes before choosing.

Files:
- `04_build_guides/01_mvp_shapes.md`
- `04_build_guides/02_recommended_architectures.md`
- `05_prompts/06_risk_review_prompt.md`

Output:

```
## MVP Options
1. …
2. …
3. …

## Recommended MVP
## Why
## What we are explicitly not building
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 5 — Scope Lock (45–60 min)</strong></summary>

Pin down must‑haves, mockables, data, AI role, limits, and demo path.

Files:
- `99_templates/project_one_pager_template.md`

Key sentence:

> By Sunday, we will show a prototype that helps [user] do [specific thing] using [specific data/docs], without pretending to do [dangerous overclaim].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phases 6–9 — Build → Validate → Demo</strong></summary>

Build:
- Break work into FE/BE/data/content; assign source verification and demo owner.
- Keep AI constrained to explanation, retrieval, comparison, and guidance.

Validate:
- Use risk review prompts and red flags; check source links and clarity.

Demo:
- Follow `04_build_guides/05_demo_advice.md`.

</details>

---

## Verification Workflow

1) Add official URLs and dates in `evidence_log.md`; flip status to Verified.
2) Mirror verified sources into `02_data/source_inventory.csv` with access mode and key fields.
3) After verification, promote findings into the Executive Brief inside `research_notes.md`.

---

## Hackbot Helper

You can use Hackbot to reconstruct context, run research, and shape an MVP.

- Boot prompt: `HACKBOT_BOOT_PROMPT.md`
- Skills: `skills/**/SKILL.md` (repo_memory, problem_scoping, research_runner, dataset_mapper, opportunity_mapper, mvp_designer, risk_review, demo_coach, repo_librarian, continuity_planner)
- Team profile (recommended): `99_templates/team_profile_template.md`

Notes:
- Hackbot never invents government programs or legal eligibility. It cites official sources and encourages verification.
- For best results, create a team profile so Hackbot can map tasks to roles and follow your communication preferences.

## Appendix: Pillar Context & Rubric

- Resident Service Navigation has stronger implicit champion support (Pete Briel, Director of 311) but commitment is not formalized.
- Procurement Risk Review lacks a named departmental champion.
- Sample procurement PDFs are not pre-staged.
- 311 routing decision logic is undocumented.

Targeted Statement 1: Helping Residents Find the Right City Service or Next Step (Score 27/32 — Strong)
- Problem, context, constraints, success, data constraints are in `01_problem_space/02_targeted_problem_statements.md`.
- Key champion contact: Pete Briel, Director of 311 (not yet formally committed).

Targeted Statement 2: Helping City Staff Review Procurement Risks and Opportunities (Score 22/32 — Needs work)
- Problem, context, constraints, success, data sources are in `01_problem_space/02_targeted_problem_statements.md`.
- Lacks named champion; sample PDFs not staged; procurement workflow undocumented.

Blue Sky Statements
- See `01_problem_space/01_bluesky_problem_statements.md`.

Prioritized Actions Before March 27, 2026
1) Name departmental champion (Pete Briel for Resident Service Navigation)
2) Pre-stage sample procurement PDFs (5–10 representative contracts)
3) Document the 311 routing decision logic
4) Specify output types for each problem statement
5) Verify rva.gov sitemap and structured data availability
